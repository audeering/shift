00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
The unknown grandmother

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,513
Like most children of my generation, Iâ€™ve  spent my holidays in the countryside,

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,593
at my grandparents, in a village of Transylvania.

4
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:17,806
I remember my grandmother working all day in the household with  her rough hands.

5
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:25,380
Today, after forty years I open the dowry chest that I have from her and my heart fills with hope.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,413
1930 it is the year of her wedding.

7
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:37,340
The bottom of the costume was also decorated with rich lace

8
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:43,320
In a fragment of photo I can see my grandmother in 1941.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,580
She was already wearing a Romanian blouse of married woman, sewn with black,

10
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,667
after a pattern brought from Sibiu by her brother.

11
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:56,600
He also brought her melted linen cloth and felt from Oradea and also special threads.

12
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,320
Late in the evening, after all the hard works in the field and the household,

13
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:06,040
after she was putting the chidren to sleep, my grandmather started to sew.

14
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:11,434
But my grandmother was also cultivating hemp, spinned bundles, used to spin and weave.

15
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:18,220
She made towels, decorative napkins to be put at the icon, table cloths and bed sheets,

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,100
everything that was necessary in a household with eight people.

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,540
All these special things were created and worn in the old house

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,500
in which they lived until 1947.

00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:40,173
