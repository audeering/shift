In the heart of the ancient city of Timacum Minus, nestled among the ruins, 
a timeless relic was discovered: the head of Fortuna, crafted from pristine white marble. 
This exquisite piece, a testament to the artistry of its time, 
bore the serene and dignified features of the goddess of fortune herself.
Her hair, meticulously combed into soft curls, gathered into a low bun parted gracefully in the middle. 
Atop her head rested a kalathus, a basket-shaped cap symbolizing abundance and prosperity. 
Fortuna face, with its regular features, told a story of divine grace and authority. 
Her high forehead and large, expressive eyes, emphasized by delicately carved pupils, 
imparted a sense of wisdom and insight. A straight, 
sharp nose and a prominent chin further accentuated the solemnity of her visage, 
capturing the essence of a deity who presided over fate and fortune.
The head of Fortuna, however, bore the scars of time and conflict. 
During the bombing of Nis in 1944, the statue suffered damage, leaving the kalathus chipped and broken. 
Yet, even in its damaged state, the head retained its majestic aura, a silent witness to the trials and tribulations of history.
In Roman religion, Fortuna, 
known as Tyche in Greek mythology, was revered as the goddess of wealth and fate, the very embodiment of luck. 
She was often depicted with symbols of her dominion: a rudder to steer the course of destiny, 
a ball to represent the fickleness of luck, a wheel of fortune to signify the ever-changing nature of life, 
and a cornucopia to symbolize abundance. 
In this particular representation, she was adorned with the kalathus, underscoring her role as a provider of prosperity.
As the head of Fortuna stands today, it continues to evoke a sense of awe and reverence. 
It tells a story of ancient beliefs, divine authority, and the enduring quest for fortune and fate. 
This marble head, with its timeless beauty and historical significance, 
remains a powerful reminder of the rich cultural heritage of the ancient world.
