1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,040
The original head of Fortuna is made of white marble,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,880
found at the Timacum Minus archaeological site,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,880
The hair is combed in curls into a low bun, parted in the middle.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:23,200
On the head of the goddess is a kalathus (basket-shaped cap, a basket).

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,760
Regular facial features, a high forehead, large eyes and pupils accentuated by a piercing

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,040
a straight, sharp nose and a prominent chin further emphasize the seriousness of the goddess.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,160
The head was damaged during the bombing of Nis in 1944 when the cap was damaged.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Fortuna (Tyche in Greek mythology), was the goddess of wealth or fate,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,480
and the embodiment of luck in Roman religion.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,120
She was usually depicted with a rudder, a ball, a wheel of fortune and a cornucopia

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,760
or, as in this case, with a kalathus.
